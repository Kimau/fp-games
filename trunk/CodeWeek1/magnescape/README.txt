Aim
---

The aim of the game is to evade and destroy the enemy ships trying to keep you away from
the portals home. You are one of the few pilots who's ship has been equiped with the
prototype "Magna" secondary weapon. This will alter the flight path of both friendly, and
enemy fire. This can be used to bend bullets around obstacles, to throw fire off
course, or even direct enemy fire into other enemies!
