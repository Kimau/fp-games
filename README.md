_Really OLD OLD old code_

This a collection of small game projects, as well as attached projects made by Flammable Penguins. None of these are really big enough for their own SVN so I've compiled them all into one nice SVN. Mostly so people can use them, also because some stuff will be of interest and I don't have time to continue the projects.

Please note that MANY projects use the [http://www.phelios.com/ptk/](PTK library) and all projects are compiled on Win32 platform, the code should be portable however.

All code is released under GPL however all Worlds, Characters, Stories, and the creative content of the works is copyright and should not be copied, derived or reused without my explicit permission. Jewel of Worlds and Phantom are the two main ones on this stem.

* PTK = PTK Library
* GL = OpenGL
* GLUT = Glut
* CON = Console
