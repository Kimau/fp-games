Photoshop RAW File convertor
-----------------------------------

Simply stated it takes a greyscale raw file and turns it into a text format which can be pasted into a Jewl of World Map file.

This is a quick fix tool so don't expect rocket science here.

To Use:
+ Create a greyscale image in the exact dimensions of the map pixel for pixel.
+ Black is GROUND level White is your highest. Give your image a full contrast. In other words use the entire colour spectrum.
+ Save as a RAW file
+ Run the program as follows
	RawConv Filename XSize YSize MaxHeight
The dafault values are map.raw, 50,50,50. Use full contrast so max height is your max height.
+ The output will be saved into a file called output.txt
+ Open file and copy height data.

Alternative Use
This program can be used as your texture mapper if you just change the range to sixteen and carefull control you colours. A bit of trickery but it works.
